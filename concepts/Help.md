## Getting Help

### `whatis`

You can use this to fine out one-line descriptions of the command you pass it.

You use this like:

```bash
whatis cat
```

### `man`

Shows the manual for the command you pass it.

You can then use vim like controls to move around and search. You can quit with `q`.

You use this like:

```bash
man cat
```
